# üá¨üáß UK Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF)

The **Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF)** is the national qualifications framework for England and Northern Ireland. It provides a structured way to recognize and compare the level and size of different qualifications. The RQF replaced the Qualifications and Credit Framework (QCF) in 2015 and is regulated by Ofqual in England and CCEA Regulation in Northern Ireland.

The RQF has **9 levels** (Entry Level to Level 8), with Entry Level further divided into 3 sub-levels for more granular classification of basic skills qualifications.
