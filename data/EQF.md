# 🇪🇺 European Qualifications Framework (EQF)

The **European Qualifications Framework (EQF)** is a common European reference framework which links countries’ qualifications systems together. It acts as a translation device to make qualifications more readable and understandable across different countries and systems in Europe.

EQF has **8 levels**, each defined by a set of descriptors indicating learning outcomes: knowledge, skills, and responsibility/autonomy.
