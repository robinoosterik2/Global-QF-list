# Austrian National Qualifications Framework (NQF)

## Summary

The Austrian National Qualifications Framework (NQF), also known by its German abbreviation NQR (Nationaler Qualifikationsrahmen), is the national system for classifying qualifications within Austria. It was implemented to increase the transparency of the Austrian education system and to make Austrian qualifications more comparable and understandable across Europe, aligning with the European Qualifications Framework (EQF).

The NQF is structured into 8 levels, similar to the EQF, and qualifications are mapped to these levels based on learning outcomes.

## Objectives

- To provide a clear and transparent overview of the Austrian education system.
- To facilitate the comparison of Austrian qualifications with those from other European countries.
- To support lifelong learning by making pathways between different qualifications more visible.
- To enhance the mobility of learners and workers.

## Governance

- The OeAD (Austrian Agency for International Cooperation in Education and Culture) acts as the National Coordination Point (NCP) for the NQF.
- The official register and further information can be found at [www.qualifikationsregister.at](https://www.qualifikationsregister.at/en).

## Key Features

- **8-Level Structure:** Qualifications are assigned to one of eight reference levels.
- **Learning Outcomes Based:** The assignment of qualifications to NQF levels is based on defined learning outcomes (knowledge, skills, competence).
- **Comprehensive:** Aims to include qualifications from all areas of education: general education, vocational education and training (VET), higher education, and non-formal and informal learning.
- **Online Register:** A publicly accessible database lists qualifications that have been formally mapped to the NQF levels.
