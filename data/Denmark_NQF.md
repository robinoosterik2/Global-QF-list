# Danish Qualifications Framework for Lifelong Learning

## Summary

The Danish Qualifications Framework for Lifelong Learning (NQF) provides a comprehensive overview of officially recognized qualification levels in Denmark. It aims to support lifelong learning and make it easier to understand and compare Danish qualifications both nationally and internationally, particularly in relation to the European Qualifications Framework (EQF).

The framework helps in showing the level of different qualifications in relation to one another and is a tool for promoting educational and professional mobility.

## Objectives

- To provide a clear overview of qualification levels in the Danish education system.
- To facilitate the comparison of Danish qualifications with those from other countries, supporting the EQF.
- To promote transparency and permeability within the Danish education system.
- To support lifelong learning pathways for individuals.
- To enhance the mobility of learners and workers.

## Governance

The Danish NQF is a result of cooperation between three ministries:
- The Ministry of Higher Education and Science
- The Ministry of Children and Education
- The Ministry of Culture

The Danish Agency for Higher Education and Science is a key contact point.

## Key Features

- **Levels:** The framework describes qualifications at different levels (typically 8 levels, aligned with the EQF).
- **Lifelong Learning Focus:** Encompasses qualifications from various parts of the education system, including adult education and continuing training.
- **Transparency:** Aims to make the outcomes of learning (knowledge, skills, and competences) clear for each qualification.
- **National and International Comparability:** Serves as a tool for comparing qualifications within Denmark and with those of other countries via the EQF.
- **Specific Framework for Higher Education:** While part of the overall NQF, Danish higher education qualifications are also covered by a specific Qualifications Framework for Higher Education.
- **Online Resources:** Information on specific programmes and their NQF levels can often be found on [Uddannelsesguiden.dk (the Education Guide)](https://www.ug.dk/).
